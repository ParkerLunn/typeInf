Use SWI prolog
C++ library for prolog
signatures: last one is output [int(in), int(in), int(out)]
assignment: add things to what's given
\+ <- negation
\+ var(Fct) checks if var
\+ atom(Fct) checks if atom
! limits numner of variants 

typeExp(Fct,T):-
    \+ var(Fct),
    \+ atom(Fct),
    functor(Fct, Fname, _Nargs)
    !,
    Fct = .. [Fname|Args],
    append(Args,[T],FType).
    fType(Fname,TArgs),
    typeExpList(FType,TArgs).

asserta-> basic fact to database/ definition to database
^^ have to deleteGVars() after use because vars could be used in successive runs

global variable def:
Example:
    gvLet(name,type, [code]) -> gvLet(v,T,int) -> let v = 3 in ocaml

fType(print, [_X, unit]). /*<- takes anything as input and prints it, simple print*/
bType(String)
infer([gvLet(v,T,int)], T2). /*unit/type of whole definition*/) //list of statements that is code 
gvar(X,T). - X=v T=int.

infer([gvLet(v,T,int),gvLet(v2,T4,iToFloat(T3))], T2). /*infer wipes global variabless when run but stores after*/
T=T3, T3=int,
T4 = float,
T2=unit

gvar(X,T)
X=v2,
T=float;/*press r*/
X=v,
T=int;
X=v,
T=int;


figure out how to use trace
to test code, write variables in database and write infer to prove right type is inferred.

Assignment -> take starting code. try to make ocaml parser in prolog. have our own inference language. only talking about types encountered not values

need to do: if statements, let in, for, while, match(bonus). write tests to see if type inference works

let v = 4
gvLet(v,T,int)

let x: float = 5 
gvLet(x,float,int) <- should fail because int cannot be cast to float
 write comments of ocaml code then write prolog translation and see how type inference works

 main pattern-> separate head from body, process head, recurse on body
 
 for loops: captured different statements and executed in certain order. capture constraints. 

 type of if is same as type of then/else body, use same variable name. 

 Test-> reload main and test file before running tests

 need parens on [let f() = ...] when defining functions

 let f(x) = x+1; 
 ^^ gVar(f, [int,int]) finds that f has input/output of int/int after running

 ***write tests that has to fail -> test(Fct, [false]) gets type error when there
 is no way to do type inference(branches of if statement produce different types) or 
 gvLet(x,float,int) should fail. Need to have tests that failed correctly.

 [Args]->capital is variable. List of one element
 Args is better and if you need it to be a list [Arg|Targs] <-forces to be list or isList?
 List of two elements -> [X,Y|Tail]

 if,for and while structure:

 local variables:
    discarded after expression use.
    capture local but discard after use, don't need to use global store.
    avoid asserts, carry variables/values with you:
        prolog map type? -> paired list, some sort of key value
